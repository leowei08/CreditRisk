Data Analysis on Loan Default through Lending Club data

# Motivation
Almost everyone goes through a loan of some kind, whether it is for a car or a house, in their entire life and they amount to a great fortune for banks. Interests are centainly where the profits are, but defaults are where the risk is, and so it is of particular interest to dig deeper into what factors affect loan defaults to help financial institutions understand and regulate loans in the financial market. The dataset is from the Lending Club at Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club.
